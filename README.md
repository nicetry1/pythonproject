# pythonproject
My final project for PFCH Fall 2023, working with library metadata.

The goal of this project was to get a sense of how frequently completed various metadata fields were in three very large bibliographic data sets, in order to provide better understanding of how useful different fields might be in indexing digital files of books in a search engine.

To review the data, go to the notebook analysis.ipynb and run all cells.
